                  stars the user has. Ties are broken by the time the most
                  recent star was acquired. This is the default for this
                  leaderboard.

                  users on this leaderboard points much like the global
                  leaderboard. If you add or remove users, the points will be
                  recalculated, and the order can change. For <code>N</code>{' '}
                  users, the first user to get each star gets <code>N</code>{' '}
                  points, the second gets <code>N-1</code>, and the last gets{' '}

              local score.
